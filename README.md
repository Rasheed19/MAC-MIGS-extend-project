# MAC-MIGS-extended-project
This repository contains the codes for feature generation, selection and model building. It is a MAC-MIGS extended project titled _Data-driven Models for Battery life Prognostics_ supervised by Dr Goncalo Dos Reis.

It makes use of the data used in the paper _Data driven prediciton of battery cycle life before capacity degradation_ by K.A. Severson, P.M. Attia, et al. The data is available at https://data.matr.io/1/. Additional information can also be found in more detail in the link.

There are basically **five** folders and Jupyter notebook files in this repository. They are analysed as follows:
     - **data**: this contains the processed generated pandas frames (saved as pickle file) generated from feature generation process
     - **models**: this contains the saved models (saved as pickle file) built on the combined dataset
     - **plots**: this cosists of the plots generated from the feature selection and model building processes
     - **utils**: this contains Python files for all the processes involved in the project 
     - **Jupyter notebooks**: contains the implementations of various models and visualization of results
